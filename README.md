# Developing an E-commerce Website using ASP.NET MVC with QR Payment Integration and AI Chatbot
## Introduction and Motivation
As a graduating student, I have chosen to develop an e-commerce website using ASP.NET MVC, integrated with QR payment and an AI chatbot. My main motivation stems from the growing demand for convenience and security in online transactions. QR payment optimizes the checkout process by making it fast and secure, while the AI chatbot enhances customer experience by providing instant support. Through this project, I aim to deliver a modern and efficient e-commerce solution that meets the needs of todayâ€™s users.
